# Continuity Page — Editorial Structure & Empty-State Design (v1)

This document defines the **purpose, structure, and editorial treatment** of the Continuity page.

It exists to ensure the Continuity page never feels empty, unfinished, or purely mechanical — even when it contains very little data.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Continuity page represents a reader’s **ongoing reading history**.

It is:
- A record of progression over time
- A living archive
- A personal timeline of engagement

Continuity is **not**:
- A feed
- A dashboard
- A stats page

> Continuity should feel like a quiet journal — not a stream.

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Continuity reflects time, not volume.**

An early Continuity with one entry is as valid as one with one hundred.

The page must:
- Respect early states
- Avoid urgency
- Imply growth without prompting it

---

## 3. Page Hierarchy (Locked)

### Order of Elements

1. Page title
2. Descriptor line (editorial framing)
3. Divider
4. Continuity stream (entries)
5. Optional contextual meta

This hierarchy must be preserved.

---

## 4. Title & Descriptor

### Title

```
CONTINUITY
```

### Descriptor (Required)

A single calm sentence beneath the title.

Approved options:

- *Your personal reading canon.*
- *A record of what you’ve read over time.*
- *Where your reading history takes shape.*

Rules:
- Sentence case
- No calls to action
- No instructional language

---

## 5. Continuity Stream

### Definition

The Continuity stream displays **chronological entries** whenever a reader:
- Marks a comic as Read
- Marks a comic as Reread
- Adds an Owned work

Each entry represents a **moment**, not an achievement.

---

## 6. Entry Structure (Conceptual)

Each Continuity entry may include:

- Comic cover (small)
- Title
- Year
- State (Read / Owned / Reread)
- Timestamp (relative or absolute)

Example:

```
FROM HELL
Read · Dec 2025
```

Rules:
- No engagement counts
- No reactions
- No likes

---

## 7. Empty & Early States (Critical)

The Continuity page must **never appear broken or blank**.

### Zero-State Copy

When no entries exist:

```
Your Continuity hasn’t begun yet.
A personal canon forms over time.
```

Optional supporting line:

```
It starts the moment you mark something as read.
```

### Early-State Copy (1–3 entries)

When entries exist but are few:

- Do not hide the stream
- Do not replace with onboarding UI
- Allow space to breathe

Optional editorial line:

- *This is the beginning of your reading history.*

---

## 8. Visual & Layout Rules

- Stream is vertically constrained (not full-width)
- Left-aligned content
- Generous vertical spacing
- No cards; entries feel list-like and archival

Empty space is intentional and should feel calm.

---

## 9. What the Continuity Page Must Never Become

The Continuity page must not include:

- ❌ Sorting controls
- ❌ Filters
- ❌ Performance metrics
- ❌ Likes or followers
- ❌ Calls to add more content

If the page feels like a feed, it has failed.

---

## 10. Design Intent Check

Ask:

> *Does this page still feel meaningful with only one entry?*

If yes, the design is correct.

---

## 11. Summary (Locked)

- Continuity is a timeline, not a grid
- Editorial framing is required
- Early states are respected
- No pressure, no performance
- Growth is implied, never demanded
