# Lists — Curated Reading Paths (v1)

This document defines the **Lists feature** in Continuity.

Lists allow readers to create and share **intentional collections of comics**—centered on creators, themes, or personal reading journeys—without turning the product into a social feed.

---

## 1. Purpose

Lists exist to answer one question:

> *If someone likes this creator or theme, where should they start?*

Lists are designed to be:
- Editorial
- Opinionated
- Bounded
- Shareable

They are not designed for debate, ranking, or engagement farming.

---

## 2. What a List Is

A List is:
- A named collection of comics
- Ordered or unordered
- Created by a reader
- Intended to act as a reading path

Common List types:
- Creator-focused (e.g. *“Grant Morrison — The Good Stuff”*)
- Theme-based (e.g. *“Modern Sci‑Fi Comics Worth Reading”*)
- Personal journeys (e.g. *“What Got Me Into Image Comics”*)

---

## 3. What a List Is NOT

Lists must never become:
- Comment threads
- Ranking engines
- Popularity contests
- Debate surfaces

Explicit exclusions for v1:
- ❌ No comments
- ❌ No likes
- ❌ No follower counts
- ❌ No algorithmic ranking

Lists are **letters**, not conversations.

---

## 4. Creating a List

### Entry Points

- Creator pages
- Long Boxes
- Comic detail pages (“Add to List”)

### Required Fields

- **Title**
- **Comics** (one or more)

### Optional Fields

- One-line description (editorial tone encouraged)
- Manual ordering

### Visibility Options

- **Private** — visible only to the creator
- **Unlisted** — accessible via direct link
- **Public** — discoverable inside Continuity

No tags or metadata required in v1.

---

## 5. List Display (Reader View)

When viewing a List, users see:
- Title
- Optional description
- Ordered list of comics

Each comic entry includes:
- Cover image
- Title
- Primary action: **Add to Continuity**

Optional secondary actions:
- Mark as Read
- Add to Long Box

No additional context is shown.

---

## 6. Lists & Continuity Integration

From a List, users may:
- Add individual comics to their Continuity
- Progress through the List at their own pace
- Leave their own private notes

Lists do **not** auto-add comics or change user state.

Reader agency is preserved.

---

## 7. Sharing Rules (Summary)

- Lists may be shared via clean URLs
- Shared pages show only List content
- No exposure of user profiles, notes, or activity

(Full rules defined in `list-share-page-layout.md`)

---

## 8. Placement in the App

Lists may appear:
- On Creator pages (if public)
- In the Identity section (“Your Lists”)
- As standalone shared pages

Lists must not appear:
- In a global feed
- As ranked or trending content

---

## 9. Naming (Locked)

The feature name is:

> **Lists**

Alternatives intentionally rejected:
- Playlists
- Threads
- Recommendations

---

## 10. V1 Scope (Locked)

Included:
- Create List
- Share List
- Add comics from a List to Continuity

Excluded:
- Comments
- Likes
- Following Lists
- Featured or trending Lists

---

## 11. Design Philosophy

Lists should feel:
- Calm
- Intentional
- Editorial
- Useful even when read silently

If a List feels like a debate waiting to happen, it is designed incorrectly.
