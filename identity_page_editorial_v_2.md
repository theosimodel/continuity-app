# Identity Page — Reader Card & Canon Summary (v2)

This document defines the **final editorial direction** for the Identity page in Continuity.

It replaces all prior Identity concepts, dashboards, metrics, and activity visualizations.

The Identity page is a **reader card**, not a profile or performance surface.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Identity page answers a single question:

> *Who is this reader, based on what they’ve chosen to keep?*

It is not concerned with frequency, streaks, or output.

Identity in Continuity is **authorship**, not activity.

---

## 2. Core Principle

**A reader is defined by their canon, not their cadence.**

The Identity page must feel:
- Calm
- Editorial
- Personal
- Non-performative

If it feels like a dashboard, it has failed.

---

## 3. Page Hierarchy (Locked)

The Identity page follows a strict vertical hierarchy:

1. Reader Header
2. Divider
3. Canon Summary (editorial)
4. Defining Works (optional)

No additional sections may be introduced in v2.

---

## 4. Reader Header

### Required Elements

- Avatar
- Username

### Description Copy (Required)

One short sentence beneath the name.

Approved copy:

```
This is your reader record — shaped by what you’ve read, kept, and revisited.
```

Rules:
- Sentence case
- No platform language (no “presence”, no “stats”)
- No calls to action

---

## 5. Removed Elements (Explicit)

The following elements **must not exist** on the Identity page:

- ❌ Activity graphs
- ❌ Time-series charts
- ❌ Daily / weekly breakdowns
- ❌ Performance language
- ❌ Engagement metrics
- ❌ Achievement framing

The Identity page is timeless by design.

---

## 6. Canon Summary (Editorial)

### Section Title

```
READER PROFILE
```

### Content

Short, language-first descriptors that summarize reading tendencies.

Examples:

- *Reads across genres and eras*
- *Returns often to long-form series*
- *Drawn to creator-driven work*

Rules:
- No numbers
- No rankings
- No comparisons
- Generated or static, but always editorial

This section may be empty or hidden until sufficient data exists.

---

## 7. Defining Works (Optional)

### Section Title

```
DEFINING WORKS
```

### Content

- 3–5 comic covers
- Displayed without labels or counts
- Selected based on rereads, ownership, or explicit user pinning (future)

Purpose:

> Show taste, not volume.

Rules:
- No ratings
- No timestamps
- No explanations required

---

## 8. Visual & Layout Rules

- Content width matches Continuity and Library pages
- Vertical spacing is generous
- Sections feel editorial, not modular
- Empty space is intentional

Identity should feel like front matter, not a feed.

---

## 9. Design Intent Check

Ask:

> *Would this page feel appropriate as the inside cover of a personal reading journal?*

If yes, the design is correct.

---

## 10. Summary (Locked)

- Identity is a reader card
- No activity or performance visuals
- Canon over cadence
- Language over metrics
- Taste over output
