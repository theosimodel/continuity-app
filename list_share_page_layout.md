# List Share Page — Layout & Behavior Rules (v1)

This document defines the **layout, content rules, and behavioral constraints** for List share pages in Continuity.

List share pages are the primary **external growth surface** for the product.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Share Page

A List share page exists to:

- Communicate **taste and intent**
- Provide a **clear reading path**
- Invite readers to **begin their own Continuity**

It must work equally well for:
- Logged-out users
- First-time visitors
- Returning signed-in users

The page should feel like:
> *An editorial handoff, not a social profile.*

---

## 2. Page Structure (Locked)

### Vertical Layout Order

1. List Header
2. List Description (optional)
3. Comic List (primary content)
4. Conversion CTA
5. Editorial Footer

No additional sections allowed in v1.

---

## 3. List Header

### Required Elements

- **List Title**
- Optional subtitle:  
  `A curated reading path`

### Rules

- No username required in header
- No avatar dominance
- If author is shown, it must be subtle and secondary

Example:
```
Grant Morrison — The Good Stuff
A curated reading path
```

---

## 4. List Description

### Rules

- Max 2–3 short lines
- Editorial tone encouraged
- No emojis
- No hashtags
- No rankings language

Good:
> “Where to start if you’re curious about Morrison but don’t want the chaos.”

Bad:
> “🔥 BEST MORRISON BOOKS 🔥”

---

## 5. Comic List (Primary Surface)

### Each Comic Card Must Include

- Cover image
- Title
- Year (optional)
- Publisher (optional)
- Primary action:
  - **Add to Continuity**

### Optional Secondary Actions

- Mark as Read
- Add to Long Box

### Explicitly Excluded

- No like counts
- No comments
- No ratings
- No popularity signals

The comic list should feel **timeless**, not reactive.

---

## 6. Conversion CTA (Critical)

This is the **only strong CTA on the page**.

### CTA Copy (Locked)

Primary:
> **Start your Continuity**

Secondary (small text):
> Track what you read. Build your personal canon.

### Behavior

- Logged-out users → Auth → Guided onboarding
- Logged-in users → Add flow or Continuity page

### Rules

- One CTA only
- No competing buttons
- No urgency language

---

## 7. Share Page Privacy Rules

List share pages must:

- Never expose private notes
- Never show reading timestamps
- Never show user activity history
- Never auto-add comics

A shared List is **a recommendation, not a commitment**.

---

## 8. Visual Design Rules

- Same typography as Home (IBM Plex)
- Same background and color system
- Accent color used only for:
  - Primary CTA
  - Hover states
- No experimental layouts

Share pages must feel:
> *Official, calm, and trustworthy.*

---

## 9. Footer (Required)

### Approved Footer Content

```
Continuity
© 2025

Privacy · Terms · About
```

### Rules

- Subtle divider
- Reduced contrast
- No additional links
- No slogans

---

## 10. What Makes a Good Share Page

A share page succeeds if:
- It reads cleanly without scrolling
- It makes you want to read at least one comic
- It makes starting Continuity feel obvious
- It never pressures you to engage socially

If a share page feels loud, it’s wrong.

---

## 11. Growth Philosophy (Locked)

Continuity grows by:
- Taste
- Trust
- Thoughtful curation

Not by:
- Virality
- Metrics
- Discourse

List share pages are **quiet invitations**, not megaphones.
