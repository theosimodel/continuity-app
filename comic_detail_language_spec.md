# Comic Detail — Language Specification (v1)

This document defines the **approved language, labels, and copy rules** for the Comic Detail page in Continuity.

Its purpose is to ensure the page reads as a **personal archive and reference record**, not a storefront or social post.

All copy decisions below are **locked for v1**.

---

## 1. Page Role

The Comic Detail page represents a **canonical record of a comic issue or volume**.

It should feel:
- Calm
- Authoritative
- Editorial
- Non-commercial

It should *not* feel:
- Promotional
- Social
- Editable by default

---

## 2. Title Treatment

### Display
- Comic title is **read-only** for standard users
- Title represents the canonical work

### Editing Rules
- Title editing is restricted to:
  - Admin / curator roles
  - Explicit editor modes

If a user-facing edit exists, it must be clearly labeled:
> **Custom display title (optional)**

This prevents accidental ownership over the work itself.

---

## 3. Credits (Writer / Artist)

### Disallowed Language
- `Unknown`

### Approved Replacements
- `Credits pending`
- `Not yet credited`

### Visibility Rule
- If no data exists, the field may be hidden entirely

This preserves trust and avoids the appearance of missing or broken data.

---

## 4. Story Section

### Header (Locked)
> **Story Brief**

### Rationale
- "Synopsis" feels commercial
- "Story Brief" feels archival and editorial

This label is correct and should not be changed.

---

## 5. Reading Status

### Section Header
**Approved:**
> Your reading status

**Disallowed:**
- YOUR STATUS

The approved label is calmer and more descriptive.

### Status Options (Locked)
- Read
- Owned
- Want
- Reread

No additional states in v1.

---

## 6. Metrics Language

### Continuity Metric

**Purpose:**
Indicates how many users have included this comic in their personal canon.

**Approved Labels (choose one):**
- `In 12,483 Continuities`
- `Appears in 12,483 personal canons`
- `Added to 12,483 Continuities`

**Disallowed:**
- `Fans`
- `Popularity`
- Raw numbers without context

---

### Rating Metric

**When data exists:**
- Display aggregated average rating

**When data does not exist:**

**Approved Copy:**
- `Not yet rated`
- `No community rating yet`

**Disallowed:**
- Dashes (`—`)
- Empty states with no explanation

The absence of a rating must feel intentional.

---

## 7. Actions Language

### Primary Actions
- Mark as: Read / Owned / Want / Reread

### Secondary Actions

**Share**
- Label remains simply `Share`
- Share modal header must read:
  > **Share this comic with context**

**Add to List**
- Approved label:
  > `Add to reading list`

This is clearer for first-time users.

---

## 8. Tone Rules (Global)

All Comic Detail copy must be:
- Neutral
- Informational
- Reader-respectful

Avoid:
- Marketing language
- Calls to action beyond functional ones
- Engagement bait

---

## 9. Summary (Locked)

If the Comic Detail page feels like:
> a library card you trust

then the language is correct.
