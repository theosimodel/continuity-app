# Comic Detail Page — Continuity (v1 Final)

This document defines the **final, approved Comic / Work Detail page** for Continuity after removing the large bottom CTA. It supersedes previous Comic Detail specs and should be treated as **locked for v1**.

---

## 1. Page Philosophy

The Comic Detail page is **not a funnel**.

It exists to:

- Present the work clearly
- Show how it fits into a reader’s Continuity
- Allow lightweight annotation without pressure

Primary principle:

> The work is the hero. Actions are contextual, not dominant.

---

## 2. Page Layout (Three Columns)

### A. Cover Column (Left)

**Contents**

- Comic cover
- Fixed aspect ratio
- No overlays, badges, or CTAs

**Below cover — State Actions**

```
MARK AS
[ Read ] [ Owned ]
[ Want ] [ Reread ]

Share
```

Rules:

- Reread is the canonical "favorite" signal
- No Like / Favorite button exists
- Buttons are equal visual weight

---

### B. Content Column (Center)

#### Title Block

- Title
- Year
- Publisher

---

#### Creator Credits

```
WRITER
Name

ARTIST
Name
```

---

#### Story Brief

**Label**

```
STORY BRIEF
```

**Content** Short editorial description of tone and premise.

---

#### Add to Your Continuity (Contextual Tool)

This section **remains**, but is no longer reinforced by a large CTA.

**Purpose**

- Optional annotation
- Personal memory capture
- Never required to proceed

**Container Rules**

- Width constrained to content column
- Visually secondary to Story Brief
- Calm surface treatment

---

##### Rating

```
Your take
[ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ]
```

Rules:

- Rating is optional
- No submission pressure
- No CTA button tied to rating

---

##### Notes Input

**Default State**

- Collapsed
- 1–2 lines (\~44–56px)

**Placeholder**

```
Add a thought (optional)
```

**Expanded State**

- Expands on focus or typing
- Max height: \~160–200px

Intent:

- Notes, not reviews
- A sentence is enough

---

### C. Meta Column (Right)

#### Continuity Signal

```
CONTINUITY
12,483 in Continuity
```

Rules:

- Replaces any concept of Fans or Likes
- Represents readers who added the work to Continuity

---

#### Aggregate Rating

```
RATING
3.9
```

Optional:

---

## 3. Removed Elements (Explicit)

The following elements **do not exist** on the Comic Detail page:

- ❌ Large bottom "ADD TO CONTINUITY" button
- ❌ Like / Favorite button
- ❌ Fans count
- ❌ Log / Record language
- ❌ Required reviews

All additions to Continuity occur through:

- State actions (Read / Owned / Want / Reread)
- Global Add to Continuity control
- Passive annotation (rating / notes)

---

## 4. Interaction Model

- Selecting a state immediately updates Continuity
- Notes and ratings autosave
- No explicit submit action
- No blocking flows

---

## 5. Design Rules (Locked)

- No dominant CTAs on detail pages
- No pressure language
- No duplicated actions
- Continuity is implied, not forced

---

## 6. Summary (v1 Final)

- Comic Detail page is calm and editorial
- Continuity actions are contextual
- Large CTA removed by design
- Page encourages reflection, not performance
