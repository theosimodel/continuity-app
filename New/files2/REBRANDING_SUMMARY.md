## The New Identity

### Character Traits
**The Archivist** is:
- 🏛️ Ancient keeper of all comic book knowledge
- 📖 Has cataloged every comic in existence
- 🔮 Wise but approachable
- 💜 Uses purple as signature color
- 🌟 More mysterious and intriguing than "Librarian"

### Example Personality
**Before**: "I'm your friendly librarian who remembers what you've read"
**After**: "I am The Archivist - keeper of all comic book knowledge across all timelines and realities. I have cataloged every comic in existence and remember your personal journey through them."

## Why This Works Better

### 1. More Unique
- "Librarian" = generic, could be for any media
- **"The Archivist"** = specific, memorable, ownable

### 2. Better Branding
- "Ask The Archivist" sounds more intriguing
- Can develop visual identity (hooded figure, ancient tomes)
- Feels like a character, not just a feature

### 3. Comic Book Vibes
- Fits superhero/comic aesthetic
- Could have a backstory/lore
- Sounds like a character from a comic shop or secret vault

### 4. Marketing Potential
- "Consult The Archivist"
- "The Archivist knows your collection"
- "Every comic in existence, cataloged by The Archivist"
