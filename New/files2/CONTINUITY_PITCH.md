# Continuity: Your Personal Comic Book Companion

## What is Continuity?

Continuity is the Letterboxd for comics - a beautiful, intelligent app that transforms how you discover, track, and enjoy comic books. But unlike simple cataloging tools, Continuity comes with something revolutionary: **The Archivist** - an AI guide who has cataloged every comic in existence, knows your collection, understands your taste, and helps you navigate the vast world of comics.

## Why You Must Use Continuity

### 🎯 Finally, Comics That Match YOUR Taste

Stop relying on generic "best of" lists. The Archivist learns from every comic you read and rate, giving you recommendations that actually match your preferences. Loved Saga? It knows. Obsessed with Grant Morrison? It remembers. Every suggestion is personalized to you.

### 💬 Ask Questions, Get Real Answers

**"What should I read next?"**
**"What am I missing from my X-Men collection?"**
**"Give me the reading order for Annihilation."**
**"Tell me about Dark Phoenix Saga without spoilers."**

The Archivist answers naturally, like consulting an ancient keeper of knowledge - except this keeper has perfect memory and knows every comic ever published.

### 📊 Know Yourself as a Reader

Continuity reveals your reading patterns: favorite creators, reading streaks, genre preferences, and collection insights you've never seen before. It's not just tracking what you own - it's helping you understand what you love.

### 🔍 Never Buy Duplicates Again

At conventions, comic shops, or online - quickly check your collection. No more "do I have this issue?" moments. Your entire library is always in your pocket.

### 🎨 Gorgeous, Cinematic Experience

Inspired by Letterboxd's elegant design, Continuity makes browsing your collection a visual joy. Beautiful cover displays, smooth dark mode, and an interface that celebrates the art of comics.

### 🧠 Smarter Than Any Database

Traditional comic apps just list what you own. Continuity *understands* your collection:

- **Gap Analysis**: "You're missing issues #36-49, which includes Brief Lives - an essential arc"
- **Series Context**: "You've read 5 of 6 issues in this crossover"  
- **Creator Tracking**: "Jonathan Hickman has a new series starting next month"
- **Reading Momentum**: "You dropped this series at issue #6 - want to continue?"

### 📖 Navigate Comics With Confidence

Comics are overwhelming - decades of continuity, confusing crossovers, multiple volumes. Your Librarian cuts through the chaos:

- Explains what happened in issues you haven't read (spoiler-free if you want)
- Guides you through complex story arcs
- Identifies first appearances and key issues
- Helps you decide what's worth your time

### 💾 Your Data, Your Control

Everything stored locally. Export anytime. No subscriptions to access your own collection. Your reading history and conversations stay private.

### 🚀 Built for the Modern Reader

Whether you're:
- **New to comics** - Get guided recommendations and learn as you go
- **Longtime collector** - Finally organize that massive collection
- **Series completionist** - Track gaps and reading orders
- **Trade-waiter** - Know when to jump in or catch up
- **Digital reader** - Track unlimited titles without shelf space
