# Static Pages — Layout, Legal, & Launch Pack (v1)

This document consolidates the **approved layout rules**, **legal page standards**, and a **pre-launch checklist** for Continuity’s static pages (Privacy, Terms, About).

It is intended to be the single reference before deploying to Vercel.

---

## 1. Static Page Layout (Locked)

All static pages must share the same layout structure to maintain consistency and trust.

### Required Structure

1. Minimal top navigation
2. Primary content column
3. Editorial footer (endnote)

No additional sections may be introduced in v1.

---

## 2. Top Navigation (Static Pages)

### Purpose

Provide orientation and an exit path without turning static pages into marketing surfaces.

### Required Elements

- Brand link: **Continuity** (routes to home)
- Primary links:
  - HQ
  - Library
  - Continuity
  - Identity

### Rules

- Same typography and color system as Home
- No CTAs
- No auth prompts
- No section highlighting required

---

## 3. Content Column Rules

- Max width: \~720px
- Generous vertical padding
- Calm, readable typography
- Plain-language copy nThese pages are informational, not persuasive.

---

## 4. Footer — Editorial Endnote (Required)

### Purpose

Signal completion and provide legal/meta access.

### Approved Content (Locked)

```

## 5. Page-Specific Content Standards

### Terms

Must include:

- “As-is” service statement

---

## 6. Typography & Color (Static Pages)

- Same background and text colors
- Accent color used sparingly (hover states only)
- No visual experiments on static pages

Static pages should feel *inevitable*, not styled.

---

## 7. Pre-Launch Checklist (Vercel)

Before publishing:

-

If all are checked, static pages are launch-ready.

---

## 8. Summary (Locked)

- Static pages share one layout
