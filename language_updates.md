This document records **all finalized naming, copy, and UX language changes** discussed after the initial `design.md`. These decisions are **locked for v1** and should be treated as the authoritative update layer.

## 1. Home (HQ) Page

### Hero Section

**Label**
- FEATURED

**Headline**
- BEYOND THE PANEL

**Primary CTA**
- **Begin Your Continuity**

> Rationale: Purpose-driven, on-brand, avoids generic SaaS language.

---

### Community Section

**Rename**
- ❌ Popular This Week
- ✅ **Trending**

> Signals momentum without hype. Neutral, familiar, and editorial.

---

### Curated Section

**Header**
- **Picks**

**Subheader**
- *From your Continuity*

> Human curation without hierarchy or algorithmic explanation.

---

## 2. Library (Search)

**Page Name**
- **Library** (not “Search Library”)

**Search Placeholder**
- *Search the library…*

> Reinforces the concept of a shared, canonical catalog.

---

## 3. Work / Issue Detail Page

### Status Block

**Rename**
- ❌ Status
- ✅ **Continuity**

**States**
- Not in your Continuity
- In your Continuity
- Added to your Continuity

---

### Read State Actions

**Context Label**
- **Mark as**

**States (unchanged)**
- Read
- Owned
- Want
- Reread

---

### Social / Taste Actions

**Rename**
- ❌ Like
- ✅ **Favorite**

### Reading Log Section

**Rename Section Header**

- ✅ **Add to your Continuity**

---

### Rating

**Rename**
- ❌ Your rating
- ✅ **Your take**

---

### Notes / Review Input

**Rename Placeholder**
- ❌ Add a review
- ✅ **Add a thought (optional)**

**UX Change (Required)**
- Input is **collapsed by default**
- Default height: **1–2 lines (≈44–56px)**
- Expands only on focus or typing
- Expanded height: **≈160–200px max**
- Never visually outweighs the primary CTA

**Intent**
- Notes should feel lightweight and optional
- A sentence is enough
- Avoid long-form "review" pressure

---

## 4. Language Principles (Reinforced)

- Avoid system words (status, log, record)
- Prefer personal, narrative language
- Notes over reviews
- Taste over metrics
- Identity over activity

> The UI should never pressure users into performing.

---

## Status
