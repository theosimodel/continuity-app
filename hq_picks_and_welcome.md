# HQ Picks & First‑Time User Welcome — Continuity

This document defines the **final behavior, language, and structure** for the HQ Picks section and the first‑time user welcome experience in Continuity.

It reflects the locked editorial decisions around human curation, calm discovery, and honest onboarding.

---

## 1. HQ Picks — Purpose

Picks exist to answer a single question for new users:

> *Where should I begin?*

They are:
- Editorial, not algorithmic
- Authored, not ranked
- Stable, not reactive

Picks are **not** a feed.

---

## 2. Picks States (Final)

### State 1 — First‑Time User (Continuity = 0)

**Section Header**
```
PICKS
Hand‑picked to start your Continuity
```

**Behavior**
- Exactly **4 picks** are shown
- Order is intentional (not ranked)
- Curated entirely by the editor (you)
- Picks remain stable for long periods

**Rotation Rules**
- 3 anchor picks remain constant
- 1 slot may rotate every 4–6 weeks
- Rotation is invisible (no labels, no badges)

---

### State 2 — Returning User (Continuity ≥ 1)

**Section Header**
```
PICKS
From your Continuity
```

**Behavior**
- Picks transition to being derived from the user’s Continuity
- Language remains unchanged over time
- Personalization improves quietly

---

## 3. Final Starter Picks (Locked)

**Order reflects onboarding flow, not quality.**

1. **Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile**  
   *A mature reimagining of fairy tales through the lens of modern society.*

2. **Hawkeye Vol. 1: My Life as a Weapon**  
   *A fun, character‑driven superhero story.*

3. **The Jetsons**  
   *A thoughtful sci‑fi story using characters we grew up with.*

4. **Wytches**  
   *A dark, unsettling horror story that lingers.*

---

## 4. Presentation Rules

- No numeric ranking
- No popularity badges
- No fan counts
- No "Recommended" language
- Covers only (clean, uncluttered)

The order itself communicates intent.
