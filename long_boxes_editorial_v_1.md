# Long Boxes — Editorial Structure & Layout (v1)

This document defines the **editorial intent, layout hierarchy, and visual framing** for the Long Boxes page in Continuity.

It exists to ensure Long Boxes feels like a **personal archive**, not a filterable grid.

---

## 1. Purpose

Long Boxes represent the comics a reader has **committed to**.

This includes works that are:
- Read
- Owned
- Reread

Long Boxes do **not** represent casual interest or discovery.

> Long Boxes should feel like a room you return to — not a dashboard.

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Editorial framing comes before tooling.**

Filters and controls exist to support reflection, not dominate the experience.

If the page feels useful before it feels meaningful, the hierarchy is wrong.

---

## 3. Page Hierarchy (Locked)

### Order of Elements

1. Page title
2. Descriptor line (editorial framing)
3. Divider
4. Filters
5. Meta count line
6. Grid of comics

This order must be preserved.

---

## 4. Title & Descriptor

### Title

```
LONG BOXES
```

### Descriptor (Required)

One short, calm sentence beneath the title.

Approved options:

- *The comics you’ve committed to.*
- *A record of what you’ve read, own, and return to.*

Rules:
- No marketing language
- No calls to action
- Sentence case preferred

---

## 5. Filters (Secondary)

Filters are **tools**, not the focus.

### Available Filters

```
ALL · READ · OWNED · WANT · REREAD
```

Rules:
- Filters appear after the descriptor
- Filters must never appear directly under the title
- Filters should be visually subdued

---

## 6. Meta Count Line (Contextual)

A quiet line above the grid to contextualize scale.

Examples:

- `1 work · Updated today`
- `5 works in your Long Boxes`

Purpose:
- Makes early states feel intentional
- Signals growth over time

---

## 7. Grid Layout Rules

### Width & Alignment

- Grid must be constrained (max-width 1100–1200px)
- Grid must be left-aligned
- Cards must never be centered on the page

This turns empty space into **negative space**, not absence.

---

## 8. Early-State Editorial Copy (Optional but Recommended)

When the collection is small (≤3 items), include one quiet editorial line.

Examples:

- *Every collection starts somewhere.*
- *This is the beginning of your archive.*

Rules:
- Not a CTA
- Not instructional
- Positioned near the grid

---

## 9. What Long Boxes Must Never Become

Long Boxes must not include:

- ❌ Empty state illustrations
- ❌ Prominent add buttons
- ❌ Walkthrough tips
- ❌ Performance metrics
- ❌ Gamification

If Long Boxes feels like a task list, it has failed.

---

## 10. Design Intent Check

Ask the following:

> *Does this page still feel right when it holds 100 comics?*

If yes, the design is correct.

---

## 11. Summary (Locked)

- Long Boxes are an archive, not a feed
- Editorial framing comes first
- Filters are secondary
- Empty space is intentional
- Growth is implied, never pushed
